# SUA to UA-CH Conversion Routines

## Introduction

Structured User Agent or SUA for short has been introduced by IAB in [OpenRTB v.2.6 spec](https://iabtechlab.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/OpenRTB-2-6_FINAL.pdf).
It contains the information passed as part of the User-Agent Client Hint HTTP headers, or that otherwise can be obtained from the NavigatorUAData.

The playground page is available [here](https://51degrees.github.io/sua-uach-conversion). 

## Rationale
Device detection services s.a. 
[51Degrees Cloud Service](https://cloud.51degrees.com/api-docs/index.html) or [51Degrees UAParser](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@51degrees/ua-parser-js) 
expect to receive a UA-CH header map as input.  Thus one can't simply feed the OpenRTB's `device.sua` object into one of these.  One first needs to convert it into the UA-CH header map format. 
This is where `convertSUAtoUACH` routine can be used. 

Vice-versa if you have received the UA-CH headers on the server as part of the (ad) request and would like to send them further as part of the OpenRTB request as `device.sua` - 
you first need to convert this header map into SUA JSON object representation.  This justifies the use of the `convertUACHtoSUA` routine. 

## Usage

### Converting SUA to UA-CH

To convert SUA to UA-CH HTTP header map representation, use the `convertSUAtoUACH` routine:

```js
import convertSUAtoUACH from "./src/convertSUAtoUACH.js";

const SUAExample = {
  browsers: [
    { 
      brand:"Not A;Brand",
      version:["99","0","0","0"]
    },
    {
      brand: "Chromium", 
      version: ["99","0","4844","88"],
    },
    {
      brand: "Google Chrome",
      version: ["99","0","4844","88"]
    },
  ],
  platform: {
    brand: "Android",
    version: ["12"],
  },
  mobile: 1,
  architecture: "arm",
  bitness: "64",
  model: "Pixel 6",
  source: 2
}

let uach = convertSUAtoUACH(SUAExample)
console.log(uach)
```

and you would run this example like:
```sh
node example_sua_uach.js
```

### Converting UA-CH to SUA

Here is an example of using the reverse `convertUACHtoSUA` routine: 

```js
import convertUACHtoSUA from "./src/convertUACHtoSUA.js";
const uach = {
  'sec-ch-ua-arch': '"x86"',
  'sec-ch-ua-bitness': '"64"',
  'sec-ch-ua-full-version-list': '"Google Chrome";v="111.0.5563.146", "Not(A:Brand";v="8.0.0.0", "Chromium";v="111.0.5563.146"',
  'sec-ch-ua-mobile': '?0',
  'sec-ch-ua-model':'',
  'sec-ch-ua-platform': '"macOS"',
  'sec-ch-ua-platform-version': '"13.3.0"'
}

let sua = convertUACHtoSUA(uach)
console.log(sua)
```

you can run this example like: 
```sh
node example_uach_sua.js
```

## Tests

You can run tests by executing: 
```sh
yarn
yarn test
```
